\begin{abstract}
When evaluating an algorithm, it is often useful to speak of it's
efficiency in terms of it's worst-case complexity.  However, for certain
algorithms, determining efficiency by theoretical analysis is difficult, and has not been
reported in the literature. This is the case for search-based test data
generation tools. This paper introduces a
framework for conducting automated empirical studies of algorithms by
doubling the size of the input and observing the change in execution
time. We apply this method to the domain of data generation for
relational database schemas.  After implementing a technique for 
systematically doubling the size of schemas, we conduct an
empirical study on the search-based data generation tool
\textit{SchemaAnalyst}. The results of our study reveal performance
trade-offs in the subsumption hierarchy for testing criterions.
