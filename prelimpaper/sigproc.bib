  abstract = "The application of metaheuristic search techniques, such as evolutionary 
              algorithms, to the problem of automatically generating software test data has been
              a burgeoning interest for many researchers in recent years. To date, work in applying 
              search techniques to structural test data generation has largely focused
              on generating inputs for test objects with input-output behaviour. This thesis
              aims to extend the approach for test objects with state behaviour. This presents
              several challenges, not least because test goals with state-based test objects may
              require input sequences to be generated. Another problem includes generating
              test data in the presence of internal variables such as flags, enumerations and
              counters. Such variables are often responsible for managing the “state” of the
              test object. However, their use can lead to information loss with regards to
              the original input conditions that lead to the fulfilment of certain test goals.
              Consequently the search receives less guidance, and may fail to find test data.
              This thesis proposes an extended evolutionary structural test data generation 
              approach that allows input sequences to be generated, and tackles internal
              variable problems through hybridization of the method with an extended chaining 
              approach. The basic idea of the chaining approach is to find a sequence of
              statements, involving internal variables, which need to be executed prior to the
              test goal. By requiring that these statements are executed, information previously 
              unavailable to the search can be made use of, possibly guiding it into potentially 
              promising and unexplored areas of the test object’s input domain. A number of 
              experiments show the value of the approach for both test objects with states and 
              test objects with input-output behaviour. For all test objects considered, higher 
              levels of branch coverage are obtained"
