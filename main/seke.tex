\begin{abstract}
When evaluating an algorithm, it is often useful to speak of it's
efficiency in terms of it's worst-case complexity.  However, for certain
algorithms, determining efficiency by theoretical analysis is difficult,
and has not been reported in the literature. This is the case for
search-based test data generation tools. This paper introduces a
framework for conducting automated empirical studies of algorithms by
doubling the size of the input and observing the change in execution
time. We apply this method to the domain of data generation for
relational database schemas.  After implementing a technique for 
systematically doubling the size of schemas, we conduct an empirical study
on the search-based data generation tool \textit{SchemaAnalyst}. The results of
our study reveal performance trade-offs in the subsumption hierarchy for
testing criterions.
