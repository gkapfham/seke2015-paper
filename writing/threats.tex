\textbf{Threats to Validity}. Our technique for doubling the number of constraints in the schema is simply to duplicate
the existing constraints. It is possible that \textit{SchemaAnalyst} does less work processing these redundant
constraints than it would given non-restated ones. However, doubling the constraints in this way is easy to
implement and, as the results show, good at revealing performance trade-offs.

Additionally, since worst-case time is only apparent for large $n$, it is possible that the experiment terminated too
quicly.  While we attempted to configure the parameters of our tool using algorithms with known worst-case complexities
and conducting preliminary experiments with various settings under manual supervision, it is possible that our
configuration was not optimized for use on the HPC cluster.
