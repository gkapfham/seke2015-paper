\textbf{Threats to Validity}. Our technique for doubling the number of constraints on the schema is simply to duplicate
the existing constraints. It is possible that \textit{SchemaAnalyst} does less work processing these redundant
constraints than it would given unique constraints. However, doubling the check constraints in this way is an easy to
implement, semantically significant way of evaluating \textit{SchemaAnalyst}.

Additionally, since worst-case time is only apparent for large $n$, it is possible that the experiment terminated too
quicly.  While we attempted to configure the parameters of our tool using algorithms with known worst-case complexities
and conducting preliminary experiments with various settings under manual supervision, it is possible that our
configuration was not optimized for use on the HPC cluster.
