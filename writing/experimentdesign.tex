\section{Empirical Analysis}
\vspace{-.05in}

\textbf{Experimental Design}. To gain a full picture of the performance trade-offs, we conducted an experiment for every
configuration of the parameter space (i.e., schema, coverage criterion, data generator, and doubling technique).

In our study, we set $\mathit{tolerance}$ to $0.40$ and $\mathit{lookback}$ to $4$. These values were
chosen by performing doubling experiments on various algorithms, with known worst-case time complexities, and observing
that the ratio converged to the correct value with this configuration.  In an effort to ensure good picks for
parameters, we also conducted preliminary experiments. We set $\mathit{minimum}$ to $20$ after observing that
\textit{SchemaAnalyst} stopped displaying constant behavior after around 5 doubles.  Preliminary studies showed that
while experiments for fast configurations could be completed in less than an hour, slower configurations required days.
Since there are over four thousand possible configurations, the study requires a substantial amount of computational
resources.  As a solution, we conducted the experiments on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster containing 195
worker nodes of various hardware configurations, ranging from 12 to 16 CPU cores and 24 to 256 GB of memory, and using
the 64-bit Redhat operating system.

% GMK NOTE: It would be better to call this a tree model instead of a regression tree -- the word regression is also
% used in the software testing literature to have a different meanining.
