\section{Empirical Analysis}

\textbf{Experimental Design}. To gain a full picture of the performance trade-offs, we conducted an experiment for every configuration
of the parameter space i.e. (schema, coverage criterion, and data generator, and doubling technique). 

In our experimental study, we set $\mathit{differanceTolerance}$ to $0.40$. This value was chosen by performing doubling
experiments on various algorithms with known worst case time complexities, and observing that the ratio converged to the
correct value when $\mathit{diff} < 0.40$.  We set $\mathit{doublesTolerance}$ to $20$ after observing that
\textit{SchemaAnalyst} stopped displaying constant behavior after around 5 doubles.  Preliminary studies showed that
while experiments for fast configurations could be completed in less than an hour, slower configurations required days.
Since there are over four thousand possible configurations, the study requires a substantial amount of computational
resources.  As a solution, we conducted the experiments on the high-performance computing cluster containing 195 worker
nodes of various hardware configurations, ranging from 12 to 16 CPU cores and 24 to 256 GB of memory, and use a 64-bit
Redhat based operating system.
