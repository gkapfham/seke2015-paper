  Goldsmith et al. \cite{Goldsmith:2007:MEC:1287624.1287681} 
  developed a system to empirically evaluate computational
  complexly.  Their system, \textit{Trend-Prof}, uses code
  instrumentation to count the number of times each block 
  of code is executed, and then
  groups these blocks by their behavior.  \textit{Trend-Prof} takes in a
  collection of workloads, user specified features of the workloads, and
  the program to be studied. This technique results in a more powerful
  analysis. However, the authors do not address the
  issue of generating the workloads necessary to achieve a meaningful
  result, and we attempt to do this automatically.  Additionally, our
  approach is novel because we apply it to a domain where the
  theoretical scalability is not yet known.
