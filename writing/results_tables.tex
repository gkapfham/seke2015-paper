While the box and whisker plots allow us to see how choices between coverage criteria and data generators affects
runtime, the question remains if these differences are statistically and practically significant. To answer this
question, we calculate the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the $\hat{A}_{12}$ test.

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is a non-parametric test for hypothesis testing.  If the result of the test is greater than
the significance level ($0.05$ is frequently used), then the collections are indistinguishable.  If however, the result
is less, then the collections are differentiable.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ test is similar, but for drawing conclusions about
the practical difference between two collections of data.  A result
$a=0.50$ means that any difference is not practically
significant, while $a>0.56$ or $a<0.44$ signifies a small difference, $a>0.64$ or $a<0.36$ denotes a medium difference,
and $a>0.71$ or $a<0.29$ indicates a large difference.

Table~\ref{tab:crites} shows the statistical tests calculated for every
pair of coverage criterion. The Wilcoxon rank sum test reveals that changing the criterion results in statistically significant differences in runtimes,
with the exception of changing between four constraints at the top of
the subsumption hierarchy and two constraints at
the bottom.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ results generally show a small to medium practical effect of switching between criteria
at the high or low end of the hierarchy, and small or no effect of switching between constraints at the same level of the
hierarchy.

The statistical tests were calculated for all pairs of data generators,
but the resulting table was excluded due to space constraints. All
combinations of data generators were statistically significant according
to the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The $\hat{A}_{12}$ test shows all choices in
data generator have at least a small practical impact, with the exception of
choosing between random and random defaults, and directed random and
directed random defaults.  Changing between these
sets of data generators results in a large to medium effect, and
comparing either of the AVM based data generators to another
primarily resulted in a small difference.
