While the box and whisker plots show how choices between coverage criteria and data generators affect runtime, the
question remains if these differences are statistically and practically significant. To answer this question, we employ
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the $\hat{A}_{12}$ effect size~\cite{mcminn2015}.

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is a non-parametric test for hypothesis testing.  If the result of the test is greater than
the significance level ($0.05$ is frequently used), then the configurations are indistinguishable.  If, however, the
result is less than the chosen level, then they are different.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ test is similar, but for drawing
conclusions about the practical difference between two collections of data.  A result of $\hat{A}_{12}=0.50$ means that
any difference is not practically significant, while $\hat{A}_{12}>0.56$ or $<0.44$ signifies a small difference,
$\hat{A}_{12}>0.64$ or $<0.36$ denotes a medium difference, and $\hat{A}_{12}>0.71$ or $<0.29$ indicates a large
difference.

Table~\ref{tab:crites} shows the statistical tests calculated for every pair of coverage criteria. The Wilcoxon
rank-sum test reveals that changing the criterion results in statistically significant differences in runtimes, with the
exception of changing between four criteria at the top of the subsumption hierarchy and two criteria at the
bottom.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ results generally show a small to medium practical effect size when switching between criteria at
the high or low end of the hierarchy, and small or no effect when switching between criteria at the same level of the
hierarchy.

The statistical tests were calculated for all pairs of data generators, but the resulting table was omitted due to space
constraints. All comparisons of data generators were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
The $\hat{A}_{12}$ values show that all choices of data generator have at least a small practical impact, with the
exception of choosing between random and random defaults, and directed random and directed random defaults.  Changing
between these data generators results in a large to medium effect, and comparing either of the AVM-based
generators to the other primarily resulted in a small difference.
