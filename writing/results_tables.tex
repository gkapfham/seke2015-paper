While the box and whisker plots show how choices between coverage criteria and data generators affect runtime, the
question remains if these differences are statistically and practically significant. To answer this question, we employ
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the $\hat{A}_{12}$ effect size.

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is a non-parametric test for hypothesis testing.  If the result of the test is greater than
the significance level ($0.05$ is frequently used), then the configurations are indistinguishable.  If, however, the
result is less than the chosen level, then they are different.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ test is similar, but for drawing
conclusions about the practical difference between two collections of data.  A result $\hat{A}_{12}=0.50$ means that any
difference is not practically significant, while $\hat{A}_{12}>0.56$ or $<0.44$ signifies a small difference,
$\hat{A}_{12}>0.64$ or $<0.36$ denotes a medium difference, and $\hat{A}_{12}>0.71$ or $<0.29$ indicates a large
difference.

Table~\ref{tab:crites} shows the statistical tests calculated for every pair of coverage criterion. The Wilcoxon rank
sum test reveals that changing the criterion results in statistically significant differences in runtimes, with the
exception of changing between four constraints at the top of the subsumption hierarchy and two constraints at the
bottom.  The $\hat{A}_{12}$ results generally show a small to medium practical effect of switching between criteria at
the high or low end of the hierarchy, and small or no effect of switching between constraints at the same level of the
hierarchy.

The statistical tests were calculated for all pairs of data generators, but the resulting table was excluded due to
space constraints. All combinations of data generators were statistically significant according to the Wilcoxon rank sum
test. The $\hat{A}_{12}$ test shows all choices in data generator have at least a small practical impact, with the
exception of choosing between random and random defaults, and directed random and directed random defaults.  Changing
between these sets of data generators results in a large to medium effect, and comparing either of the AVM based data
generators to another primarily resulted in a small difference.
