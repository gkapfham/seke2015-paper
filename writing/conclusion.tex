\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

% The automated doubling experiment was able to determine the worst case time complexity of \textit{SchemaAnalyst} with
% respect to the number of check constraints in the input schema, for the \textsc{constraintCACCoverage} criterion and the
% \textsc{directedRandom} data generator.  Additional experiments will be conducted on other criteria and data generators.
% Additionally, other factors that may influence the runtime of schema analysis, such as the number of primary keys,
% foreign keys, tables, columns, etc will be investigated.

This paper presented an automated method for empirically identifying the worst-case time complexity of search-based test
data generation methods. Focusing on the domain of relational database schemas, our approach empirically repeatedly
doubles the size of the input schema and observes the change in runtime. Although some results are inconclusive, we find
that, in some cases, data generation is linear or linearithmic and, in others, it is cubic, quadratic, or worse.  Our
automated method also revealed that, for all of the test adequacy criteria in the subsumption hierarchy presented by
McMinn et al.~\cite{mcminn2015}, stronger criteria always necessitate more time for test data generation.
