\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

The automated doubling experiment was able to determine the worst case time complexity of \textit{SchemaAnalyst} with
respect to the number of check constraints in the input schema, for the \textsc{constraintCACCoverage} criterion and the
\textsc{directedRandom} data generator.  Additional experiments will be conducted on other criteria and data generators.
Additionally, other factors that may influence the runtime of schema analysis, such as the number of primary keys,
foreign keys, tables, columns, etc will be investigated.
