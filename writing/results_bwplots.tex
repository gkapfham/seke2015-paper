While the trees provide insight into the relative impact of each
predictor on the runtime of \textit{SchemaAnalyst}, the box and whisker
plots produced as the leaves of the trees do not provide a detailed view
of the choices within each predictor.  To gain a finer level of
granularity, we produce box and wisker plots of our own.
Figure~\ref{fig:crites}, shows the effect of coverage criterion on runtime, and Figure~\ref{fig:datas},
shows the effect of data generator on runtime.

Figure~\ref{fig:crites} shows that the coverage criterions at the top of the subsumption hierarchy: AUCC, ClauseAICC, and CondAICC cause runtime to
increase.  Additionally, their is not a great distinction between criterions of the same level of the hierarchy.

Figure~\ref{fig:datas} reavles the Random and Random Defaults generators took the most amount of time by a distinctive margin, and
a less pronounced hierarchy between AVM, AVM defaults, Directed Random, and Directed Random Defaults can be observed.
